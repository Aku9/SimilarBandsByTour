    "By recommending similar artists based on touring history, we were able to increase the diversity and the genre diversity of the artists recommended over those directly presented by Spotify. Tour-based recommendations offer more artists across a broader spectrum of styles. But are these recommendations better from the perspective of the end user? Well, it depends what your point of comparison is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative to the related artists feature specifically? I'd say so. But relative to Spotify's overall approach to recommending new music? Definitely not. Spotify is a deeply data-driven company that uses a large multi-faceted algorithm to make recommendations to users. [As of 2015, three major features of the algorithm](https://www.slideshare.net/MrChrisJohnson/from-idea-to-execution-spotifys-discover-weekly/31-1_0_0_0_1) were Implicit Matrix Factorization for crunching user preference and behavioral data, Natural Language Processing to extract cultural and relational metadata from news, blogs, and playlists, and Deep Learning applied to raw audio data to classify songs and artists. I have by no means discovered a magic bullet capable of upending Spotify's cutting-edge algorithm. What I have discovered is a small blindspot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any algorithm is liable to develop biases, particularly as it expands to include many diverse features and sources of information. In this case, the bias in question is too narrow a view of which artists and genres are related to which within the context of of the related artists feature. From Spotify's perspective, a similar result could plausibly be reached by instead of simply presenting the top 10 related artists, probabalistically presenting 10 related artists from the top 200 weighted by their position on the list. The relative positional weights could then be tuned to balance the diversity and relevance of the recommendations overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other advantage of touring-based recommendations is their interpretability. Large algorithms can frequently appear opaque to humans observers, especially if they combine many different sources of information from different domains. Putting together a tour, on the other hand, is a direct function of the music industry, involving artists and other professionals like managers, agents, labels, and venue owners. By deciding which bands should go together on a tour, they contribute to the social construction of which artists are similar to which and what genres they fall into. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several further developments that would be necessary to take this method from proof-of-concept to a tool that an end-user could feasibly use to discover new artists. The limited download throughput of Setlist.fm's API reflects the fact that they are simply not as large and well-resourced as a company like Spotify. As this project is non-commercial, I decided to stick to the recommended download rate and daily cap. According to their documentation, Setlist.fm may choose to increase the download rate by 8x and the daily cap by 35x by request. However, downloading such a large quantity of data piecemeal through the API is not ideal to begin with. Determining which other artists also performed at the venue and on the date of a given setlist is responsible for the majority of the API requests performed here. [Individual setlist pages](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/beartooth/2020/o2-academy-bristol-bristol-england-1399bda1.html) will sometimes contain this information, but it is not directly available within a setlist object downloaded from the API. The addition of such a field could greatly improve the performance of the functions that compile the list of tourmates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other improvement that would be essential is [automatically cross-referencing Spotify and Musicbrainz (Setlist.fm) IDs](https://github.com/metabrainz/mbspotify). As it stands, the method is capable of providing a list of recommendations based on touring history requiring only the Musicbrainz ID of the band in question. However, in order to apply any of the metrics pulled from the Spotify API, the user must also look up and manually enter the IDs for all of the recommended bands. Automatic cross-referencing would remove this burden from the end-user, making the tool much more practical."
